# Topics

  - Abstract syntax and abstract binding trees

  - Simply-typed lambda calculus (type safety; normalization; simple
    extensions like products, sums, records, recursion, etc.)

  - System F (type safety; normalization; Church encodings)

  - Damas–Hindley–Milner type inference (prenex types; soundness &
    completeness)

  - Qualified types (à la Haskell; evidence translation)

  - Dependent types (probably like LF)

  - Substructural types (?)
